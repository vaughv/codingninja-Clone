# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## 🚀 Coding Ninjas Clone Project

This project is a simplified front-end clone of various Coding Ninjas program pages, developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It serves as a UI/UX exercise, showcasing modular component-based design and page navigation using conditional rendering—without any external routing library.

🧩 Features
🏠 Homepage
A central landing page with links to various program offerings.

📚 Program Pages
Replicated versions of popular Coding Ninjas program detail pages:

1. Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp

2. Data Analytics Bootcamp

3. Data Analytics with IIT Guwahati Certification

4. Data Science with IIT Guwahati Certification

5. Generative AI for Non-Tech Professionals (IIT Madras)

6. Generative AI Advanced Certification

7. IIT Madras Student Training & Internship - DSA

8. Student Training cum Internship Certification - Data Analytics

10. IIT Madras Student Training & Internship - Full Stack Web Development

💬 Fixed Chatbot Widget
A static, dummy chatbot interface pinned to the bottom-right of the screen. On click, it displays a default message.

📱 Responsive Design
Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a mobile-first, fluid layout.

🧱 Modular Components
Each page and reusable UI part is organized into modular, self-contained React components for better maintainability.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React.js
For creating dynamic, component-based UIs.

Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and customizable styling.

🚧 Limitations
No backend/API integration
No real chatbot functionality
No routing library like React Router; navigation is based on component state

📈 Future Improvements
Add routing via React Router
Integrate backend/API for dynamic content
Implement a real chatbot using a service like Dialogflow or OpenAI API
Add animations and transitions for smoother navigation
